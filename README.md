# Hi, I'm Alicia  
**AI Explorer & Engineer**  
Exploring how AI changes the way we build, learn, and create.

## About  
I'm a full-stack software engineer at [iRIX Software Engineering AG](https://irix.ch).  
I like to build prototypes, play with models, and see what happens when code meets curiosity.  
I share what I learn through talks and community events such as the [**AI Stammtisch Basel**](https://www.meetup.com/basel-ai-stammtisch/).

## Current Focus  
- **AI Engineering & Experiments** – testing models, building small agents, and automating workflows.  
- **Agentic Systems** – exploring how the web evolves when software starts to act on its own.  
- **Speaking & Community** – turning complex AI topics into practical conversations.
